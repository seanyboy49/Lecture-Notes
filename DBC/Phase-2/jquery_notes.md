## Basic CSS Selectors 

$ === jQuery
.klaas
var $domKlass = $('.klass'); => converts this css selector into a jQuery object 

## Chaining methods
$ Calls can be chained together

## Keyword arguments

console.log(arguments) will print all the inbound inputs to your function

## If/Else
In an if statement, if you're trying to find an object in your DOM and jQuery can't find it, it'll return an empty node list.
An empty node list is truthy, so whatever's in your if block will always run.
